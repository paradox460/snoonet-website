## Nicknames / NickServ

+ Any unregistered and otherwise available nicknames may be freely registered so long as they do not violate network policy.
+ There is a maximum of 5 grouped nicknames per account. Please use [NickServ](/anope#NickServ)'s GROUP command to add a nickname to your account as opposed to registering a new account. For more information or to request assistance, please join {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}}.
+ Nickname squatting is not permitted. We ask that all registered or grouped names be put to use.
+ Nicknames must not contain any racial slurs, bigotry, or other words and/or phrases which violate our [Terms of Service](/tos). We reserve the right to suspend, forbid and/or otherwise prohibit access to these names.
+ Temporary/disposable email addresses are prohibited. Snoonet reserves the right to delete your registration if you register with a false/throwaway email address.
+ Nicknames expire after 9999 days of no usage. Upon request in the {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} channel, accounts holding only one name and having at least 1 year of inactivity may be dropped. Nicknames grouped to any account may be ungrouped or dropped after at least 6 months of inactivity. Requests for nicknames to be made available will be subject to the discretion of staff. Requests for nicknames that violate Snoonet policies will be refused.

## Hostmasks

+ Your IP address is masked by default when you connect to Snoonet. This mask does not reveal your real IP address. When you register an account on our network and confirm your account registration, you are eligible to receive a default user cloak. If you do not wish to keep your default cloak after confirming your nickname, please reach out in {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} to have it removed.
+ Channel specific cloaks may be available. Requests for channel cloaks will be subject to staff discretion. For a user to qualify for a channel cloak, they must be on the access list of the channel in question. Please reach out in {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} for more information.
+ We do not currently offer custom vanity hosts except in special circumstances, such as network events. Users that already hold a custom vanity cloak may request their cloak be changed at any time.

## Bots

+ Bots may freely be run on our network, providing that the bot conforms to our [Terms of Service](/tos) and other network rules as outlined both above and below. Bots should have their own, separate registered account and are required to have an identifiable cloak, which includes the name of the bot as well as its operator. Bots may also set the +B user mode to identify themselves as a bot on the network in /WHOIS. If you require any assistance with getting your bot up and running on Snoonet, please join {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} and someone will be happy to assist you.
