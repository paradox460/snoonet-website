## Registering a Channel

+ Unregistered and otherwise available channels may be freely created or registered on Snoonet so long as they do not violate network policy.
+ Abandoned channels may be claimed or dropped, subject to staff discretion. This service is offered as a privilege and not a right.
+ We reserve the right to suspend or close any channels that encourage illegal activity or otherwise expose the network to liability.
+ Unicode characters in channel names are not permitted.
+ Accounts may register or otherwise be the founder of a maximum of 10 channels.
+ Do not mass register channels that you have no intention of using, or solely to reserve a specific name. Such channels may be suspended or dropped at staff discretion.

## Logging
+ It is understood that users on the network may keep their own private logs of any channel. Snoonet requests that these logs not be made public unless consent has been given by the operators of the channel in question.
